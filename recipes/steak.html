    <h3>Description</h3>
    <ul>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <li>2 (12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1½ inches thick</li>
        <li>1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <strong>Steps:</strong>
        <li>To begin, pat the steaks dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Season the steaks all over with the salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan (preferably cast iron or stainless steel) over medium-high heat until it's VERY hot.</li>
        <li>Add the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.</li>
        <li>Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so the oil doesn’t splatter in your direction. The oil should sizzle.</li>
        <li>Leave the steaks alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly; the steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for rare to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on second side).</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to the pan with the steaks.</li>
        <li><em>If you are serving the steaks unsliced,</em> transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
